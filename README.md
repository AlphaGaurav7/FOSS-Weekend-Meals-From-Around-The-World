# FOSS Weekend Meals From Around The World

## About
This project is a minimalistic website for searching recipes by country, made using vanilla JavaScript and theMealDB api, to practice ajax fetching and making modals.

## Local Setup
- After forking and cloning this repository to your local machine, open the project folder in your favourite code editor.
- Assuming you already have the "Live Server" extension installed (if not, then install it right now, it is very useful for any simple html css js project!), open `index.html` with Live Server.
- Any changes you make in the code will be reflected in the browser immediately
